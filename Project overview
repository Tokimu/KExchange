# KExchange

## Project overview

This is Kotlin Multiplatform project.
Shared code is split among many modules, where to goal was to keep as much as possible in the common code.
As for now Kotlin Mulitplaform is an experimental feature. There are many bugs and limitations.
Additionaly wanted to try to use Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI for displaying a simple UI (Views made by these frameworks doesn't meet their requirements for this task because of their limitiations for now)

##### Know issues:
- Kotlin Multiplatform project with mulitple muliplatform modules doesn't work well with the current Android Studio
(Syntax highlighting doesn't work correctly, need to rebuild single modules to see changes in other modules, gradle parallel build mode doesn't work... etc)
- For iOS Coroutines works on a main thread
- Ktor client for iOS has a know issue with memory leak
- Compose doesn't work inside KMP module
- Compose and SwiftUI are still quite buggy and perfomance of the list view is not the best

### Architecture

Architecture used for this project is redux.
Used framework: https://github.com/reduxkotlin/redux-kotlin

## How to run
##### Requirements:
 - Android Studio 4.2 Canary 1
 - For iOS, Xcode

Android app can be run like always.
To use compose view please uncomment Inent-filter for MainActivity and comment out the one in home feature module.

To run iOS:
 - Framework should be already generated and included into iOS project
 - To generate new XCFramework just build the project, framework should get generated after ssuccessfull build.
 - iOS App is definitely not production ready as of the current know issues listed above, with relase of Kotlin 1.4 it should change
